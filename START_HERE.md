## 🎨 Key Features Explained

### 1. **3D Visualization** ⭐
```
What you see:
├── Purple/Blue glowing spheres (NV centers)
├── Connecting lines (signal relationships)
├── Color changes (signal strength)
├── Size changes (attention weight)
└── Auto-rotation (cinematic effect)

What it represents:
└── Real quantum sensor network processing neural signals
```

### 2. **Interactive Sliders**
```
Noise Level (0-100%)
├── Increase to see robustness
└── GNN can still extract signals!

Signal Intensity (0-200%)
├── Control neural signal strength
└── Watch 3D nodes respond

Attention Weight (0-100%)
├── Emphasize important connections
└── See GNN learn what matters

Auto Rotate
├── Toggle camera rotation
└── Explore from different angles
```

### 3. **Signal Chart**
```
Shows 3 signals:
├── Original (cyan) - Pure neural signal
├── Noisy (pink) - Raw measurements with interference
└── Denoised (purple) - After GNN processing ✨
```
